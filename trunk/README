A VPN client compatible with Cisco's EasyVPN equipment.

Supports IPSec (ESP) with Mode Configuration and Xauth.  Supports only
shared-secret IPSec authentication, 3DES, MD5, and IP tunneling.

It runs entirely in userspace. Only "Universal TUN/TAP device
driver support" is needed in kernel.

Required Libraries: libgcrypt (version 1.1.90 for 0.2-rm+zomb-pre7 or later)

It reads configuration data from the following places:

- From command-line options
- From config file(s) specified on the command line
- From /etc/vpnc.conf
- If a setting is not given in any of those places, it prompts the user.

The configuration information it currently needs is:

          Option Config file item
	--ifname Interface name
       --gateway IPSec gateway 
            --id IPSec ID 
     (no option) IPSec secret 
      --username Xauth username 
     (no option) Xauth password 

A sample configuration file is:

# This is a sample configuration file.
Interface name vpntun0
IPSec gateway 127.0.0.1
IPSec ID laughing-vpn
IPSec secret hahaha
Xauth username geoffk

Note that all strings start exactly one space after the keyword
string, and run to the end of the line.  This lets you put any kind of
weird character (except EOL and NUL) in your strings, but it does mean
you can't add comments after a string, or spaces before them.

It may be easier to use the --print-config option to generate the
config file, and then delete any lines (like a password) that you want
to be prompted for.

If you don't know the Group ID and Secret string, ask your 
administrator. If (s)he declines and refers to the 
configuration files provided for the vpnclient program, tell 
him/her that the contents of that files is (though scrambled) 
not really protected and can be extracted using tools shipped 
with any Linux distribution.
