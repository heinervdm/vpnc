To use the hybrid extension add
	Use Hybrid Auth
to your .conf file or add
	--hybrid
when starting vpnc.

The trusted root certificate may be passed by adding
	CA-File <root_certificate.pem>
to your .conf file or adding
	--ca-file <root_certificate.pem>
when starting vpnc.

The trusted root certificate may be contained in a directory by adding
	CA-Dir <trusted_certificate_directory>
to your .conf file or adding
	--ca-dir <trusted_certificate_directory>
when starting vpnc.
The default is 
	/etc/ssl

As the trusted certificate is referenced by the hash of the subject name, 
the directory has to contain the certificate named like this hash_value. 
A link can also be used like in /etc/ssl/Certs.
The hash value can be calculated by e.g.
	openssl x509 -in <ca_certfile.pem> -noout -hash
